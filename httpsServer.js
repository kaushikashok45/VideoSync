const app = express();

// All other routes (like API endpoints) should go before the Remix handler
// app.use("/api", someApiRouter);

// IMPORTANT: Remix will create the 'build' directory and an index.js inside it.
// You need to dynamically import it because the build output changes.
// During development, the 'build' might be in a temporary location or served differently by the dev server.
// During production, it's typically 'build/index.js'.

// --- This part is crucial for Remix integration ---
// In a custom server, you typically handle two modes: development and production.
// For HTTPS in development, Remix's `dev.https` option in `remix.config.js`
// is usually for Remix's built-in dev server. If you're using a custom server.js
// for *development* AND HTTPS, it gets a bit more complex.

// Let's assume this server.js is for a production deployment, or for a dev setup
// where you manually start 'remix build' and then this server.
// For dev with HMR, Remix's built-in dev server (with dev.https in remix.config.js)
// is usually preferred.

// If you are using this `server.js` with `remix.config.js` like:
// server: "./server.js",
// then you need to make sure `createRequestHandler` gets the correct build.

// Simplified approach for a custom server.js that *might* be used for dev or prod:
const IS_DEVELOPMENT = process.env.NODE_ENV === "development";

// Define the port (it's good to use an environment variable for production)
const port = process.env.PORT || 5174;

// Handle assets served by Remix (e.g., /build/*)
app.use(express.static("public/build", { maxAge: "1h" })); // Serve public assets

app.all(
    "*",
    IS_DEVELOPMENT
        ? (req, res, next) => {
            // In development, Remix usually handles its own server and build refresh.
            // If you're explicitly using this `server.js` for development with `remix.config.js`
            // pointing to it, you'd usually pass a dynamic `build` function.
            // For simplicity and to fix the 404, we'll assume `build` is ready.
            // However, for hot reloading, Remix's built-in dev server is better.

            // For a custom dev server using Remix's dev features, you'd typically do:
            // import { createDevRequestHandler } from "@remix-run/dev/server"; // pseudo code, check Remix docs
            // createDevRequestHandler({ build, mode: "development" })(req, res, next);
            // BUT THE `build` IS NOT STATIC IN DEV!

            // For now, let's assume `remix build` has run, or you're connecting to Remix's internal dev logic
            // This setup is usually for *production* where `build` is static.
            // If you're using this for DEV, you might need a different approach entirely for HMR.

            // *************** CRITICAL FIX ***************
            // This is the core Remix integration.
            // It imports the server-side build of your Remix app.
            import("./build/server/index.js").then((build) => { // Dynamically import build
                createRequestHandler({
                    build: build,
                    mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
                })(req, res, next);
            }).catch(next); // Catch import errors
        }
        : createRequestHandler({
            // In production, the build is static
            build: await import("./build/server/index.js"), // Synchronous import for prod (only runs once)
            mode: process.env.NODE_ENV,
        })
);

// Error handling (optional, but good practice)
